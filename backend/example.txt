Patient Notes: Jane Doe presented to Cal Hacks Hospital on June 12th, 2023, with 
complaints of persistent cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Symptoms 
began approximately two weeks ago and have worsened over time. The patient reports 
a history of seasonal allergies but denies any recent exposure to allergens. Physical 
examinations reveal reduced breath sounds and wheezing upon auscultation. Initial 
diagnosis suggests possible asthma exacerbation. The patient was prescribed a 
bronchodilator inhaler to alleviate symptoms.  
Investigations: A pulmonary function test was performed to assess lung function and 
confirm the diagnosis. The results indicated a significant reduction in forced expiratory 
volume in one second (FEV1), supporting the diagnosis of asthma exacerbation. 
Additionally, an allergy panel test was ordered to identify potential triggers.  
Treatment Plan: The patient was advised to continue using the prescribed 
bronchodilator inhaler as needed for symptom relief. In addition, a short course of oral 
corticosteroids was prescribed to reduce airway inflammation. Environmental control 
measures were recommended to minimize exposure to potential triggers, such as dust 
mites and pet dander. A follow-up appointment was scheduled in two weeks to monitor 
the patient's response to treatment and adjust the management plan if necessary. 
Additional Notes: Jane Doe works as a teacher and reports occasional stress related to 
her job responsibilities. She expressed interest in exploring stress management 
techniques and was referred to a local mindfulness workshop. The patient was also 
provided educational resources on asthma management and advised to create an 
asthma action plan.
